### Server Side Rendering with React and Redux

#### No Additional Frameworks, like NEXT.JS or Gatsby

The main purpose of this application is to look under the hood of the SSR concept for React and Redux

- Renders a page each time server has a request
- Uses React-Router both on server and client sides (static router on server)
- Uses React-Router-Config
- Uses Redux on the client and server side
- Has auth with some protected routes
- Uses Helmet for SEO
